    "#### Choice of X and y variables:\n",
    "X (Electric range): Electric range was chosen as the input variable (X) because it represents a significant characteristic of electric vehicles. Electric range indicates the distance an electric vehicle can travel on a single charge. It is an essential factor in determining the capabilities and performance of electric vehicles. By using Electric range as the input, we aim to understand its relationship with the Model year.\n",

    "y (Model year): Model year was selected as the target variable (y) because it represents the year in which an electric vehicle model was manufactured. Predicting the Model year based on Electric range allows us to estimate the manufacturing year of an electric vehicle using its electric range. By developing a regression model, we can leverage historical data to make predictions about the Model year for new, unseen instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Insights about both the Modeling’s MSE and Accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - For the Gradient Boosting model, the MSE of 1.3060130525276776 suggests that, on average, the predicted values are off by approximately 1.3060130525276776 units squared. Smaller MSE values generally indicate better model performance, although the interpretation of the MSE depends on the scale and context of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For the Random Forest model, the MSE of 1.1600416634933268 implies that, on average, the predicted values deviate by approximately 1.1600416634933268 units squared from the actual values. This indicates that the Random Forest model's predictions are, on average, slightly closer to the actual values compared to the Gradient Boosting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accuracy:\n",
    "   - For the Gradient Boosting model, the reported accuracy of 85.29430221590377 suggests that the model's predictions match the actual values with an accuracy of approximately 85.29%. It is important to note that accuracy in regression tasks may not have a direct interpretation like in classification tasks, and its calculation may vary based on the specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For the Random Forest model, the reported accuracy of 86.93793902957061 indicates that the model's predictions align with the actual values with an accuracy of around 86.94%. Similarly, the interpretation of this accuracy value in a regression context may vary and depends on the specific calculation method used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) values obtained from the Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models provide insights into the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the Model year. The Gradient Boosting model has an MSE of 1.306, indicating that, on average, the predicted values deviate by approximately 1.306 units squared from the actual values. On the other hand, the Random Forest model has a slightly lower MSE of 1.160, implying that the predicted values deviate by approximately 1.160 units squared from the actual values. This suggests that the Random Forest model's predictions are, on average, slightly closer to the actual values compared to the Gradient Boosting model. However, a more comprehensive evaluation considering other metrics would be necessary to fully assess the models' accuracy and suitability for the specific task and dataset.\n",
