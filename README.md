## Project Title: Sneaker Price Prediction

### Introduction
This project aims to predict the sold prices of sneakers using various features and machine learning techniques.

### Data Preprocessing

#### Label Encoding
We used `LabelEncoder` from the `scikit-learn` library to transform categorical variables (e.g., condition, gender, brand) into numerical values. This step enabled the computation of correlation coefficients, helping us understand relationships between features and the target variable, sold price. The encoding facilitated the creation of a correlation matrix to identify significant feature associations.

### Correlation Matrix
The correlation matrix revealed that sold price had the strongest correlation with retail price. High correlations were also observed between `is_collab` and `Collaborator`, and with brand. These insights guided our feature selection for predictive modeling.

### Predictive Modeling and Evaluation
Initial attempts with linear regression models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge) yielded low R-squared values, indicating poor performance. We then employed Random Forest Regression, which significantly improved our results (MSE: 22426.16, R-squared: 0.75). This model effectively predicts sold prices, with retail price being the most influential feature, contributing approximately 48.47% to its predictive power.

### Conclusion
This project underscores the importance of data preprocessing and the efficacy of Random Forest Regression in accurately predicting sneaker prices. Insights gained will guide future feature selection and model enhancements.
