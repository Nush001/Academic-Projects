    "## Introduction: \n",
    "The 2015 census data also provides information on the distribution of tree species in the city. The three most common tree species are London planetree, Norway maple, and Callery pear. These three species comprise approximately 29% of all trees in the city. Other common species include honeylocust, pin oak, and red maple.\n",
    "The census data also reveals that most trees in the city are on private property, with 58% on residential land and 18% on commercial ground. Parks and other public spaces comprise 14% of the city's trees, and the remaining 10% are located on other public property, such as schoolyards and medians.\n",
    "The benefits of trees in urban areas are well documented, including providing shade and reducing the urban heat island effect, improving air quality, and reducing stormwater runoff. The 2015 census data highlights the importance of continued efforts to plant and maintain trees in New York City, as they provide valuable ecosystem services and improve the quality of life for city residents.\n",
    "Overall, the 2015 census data on trees in New York City provides valuable insights into the distribution and abundance of tree species in the city and the importance of continued efforts to increase the number of trees in urban areas.\n",

    "## Business Questions: \n",
    "1. Which NYC borough has the healthiest trees, and which species are naturally healthier?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are major problems that are faced by the trees in the NYC and how are they distributed across the boroughs?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis: \n",
    "As a group, we generated five dashboards shedding light on the different issues faced by the trees of New York for our analysis. We have attached the screenshots of the dashboard, the business questions, and their relevant answers for reference. \n",
    "## Dashboard 1: \n",
    "Question: Which group provided the most data in the survey of trees in New York City, and what are the seasonal variations in the trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dashboard Screenshot:\n",
    "![](cenDash5.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Observation: \n",
    "The top dashboard displays important key performance indicators (KPIs) like the number of trees studied, their health status, and the number of species surveyed. The first panel shows the tree count by user type and quarter. The second panel shows the total tree count in each borough, with Queens having the highest count. The third panel compares stump and tree diameters and shows that they increase after spring. The last panel highlights the groups involved in collecting data, with NYC Parks Staff contributing the most data, and each group collecting data during a specific season. These findings have important implications for managing urban forestry in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dashboard 2: \n",
    "Question: What are the benefits of street trees in New York City, and how can the data collected in 2015 help urban planners and policymakers make informed decisions?\n",
    "## Dashboard Screenshot: \n",
    "![](cenDash4.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Observation: \n",
    "The NYC street tree dataset collected in 2015 provides valuable information on the health, species, and location of street trees in the city. By analyzing this data, urban planners and policymakers can gain insight into the benefits of street trees, such as air pollution reduction, carbon sequestration, and energy savings. They can also identify areas with low tree coverage and prioritize planting in those areas to improve the urban environment's health and well-being. Additionally, the data can help policymakers make informed decisions about the types of trees to plant in certain areas, as well as the best practices for maintaining and protecting street trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dashboard 3: \n",
    "Question: How does the health status of trees in different boroughs of New York City vary, and what are the factors that contribute to their health?\n",
    "## Dashboard Screenshot: \n",
    "![](cenDash3.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Observation: \n",
    "The health status of trees in different boroughs of New York City varies significantly and the role of stewardship in ensuring tree health is significant. The Queens has the highest number of trees in poor health, also Queens has the highest number of trees in good health. The borough-wise analysis of the health status of trees shows that the proportion of trees in poor health is highest in the Queens, followed by Brooklyn, Staten Island, Bronx, and Manhattan.\n",
    "## Dashboard 4: \n",
    "Question: What are major problems faced by the trees in the NYC and how are they distributed across the boroughs?\n",
    "## Dashboard Screenshot: \n",
    "![](cenDash2.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Observation: \n",
    "New York City trees face two main issues: branch lights and stones. Many trees are in excellent or average condition, even among those in these groups. According to the second image, out of New York's total tree population of 100%, 4.76 percent have \"Truck & Other\" issues. Branch light issues affect 9.12% of trees, and root stone issues affect 20.47% of trees. We could visualize the relative importance of each issue within the branches using the tree map. Each municipality's trunk dimensions' spread is displayed in the final box plot graph. We observe that nearly all of trees in Queens and Brooklyn have stem diameters that are below the average and are in less than good health. On the other side, Staten Island, Manhattan, and the Bronx all have larger-than-average tree root diameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dashboard 5: \n",
    "Question: Which NYC borough has the healthiest trees, and which species are naturally healthier?\n",
    "## Dashboard Screenshot: \n",
    "![](cenDash.jpg)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Observation: \n",
    "From above dashboard and analysis, it can be said that Queens being the largest borough in NYC have the highest number of healthiest trees where London Planetree species is found to be healthier than other species. Whereas Manhattan has the smaller number of healthiest number of trees as compared to all boroughs. Also, Honey locust and London Planetree are the species found more alive in NYC. Lastly, most contribution in the survey was done by the Tree Count Staff as they surveyed most number of trees in NYC.\n",

    "## Challenges working in Tableau: \n",
    "•\tPerformance issues: Large datasets can cause performance issues in Tableau. Users might experience slower load times, lagging dashboards, or even crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tVisualization design: Creating visually appealing and informative dashboards can be challenging. It requires a good understanding of the data and the ability to choose the right visualization type for the data being presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tMaintenance: Keeping Tableau up-to-date and maintaining dashboards can be a challenge. Users may need to update data sources, fix broken links, and troubleshoot errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tCost: Tableau can be expensive, especially for enterprise-level solutions. Organizations may need to consider the cost of licensing and ongoing maintenance before committing to using the software.\n",
